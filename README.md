When you first start out vaping, you may find yourself overwhelmed with such a wide variety of options and choices. With options varying from simple & easy-to-use vapes to intricate & complex e-cigs, your choice of device is important to ensure the best vaping experience. Disposable vape pens are the simplest & easy-to-use types of vapes, providing convenience without maintenance. As for Reusable/Rechargeable vapes, some maintenance is required but offers more customization options and is more sustainable for the Earth. 

DISPOSABLE E-CIGS

Easy-to-use, all-in-one disposable vape devices that are ready to vape with everything you need to start vaping. Disposable e-cigarettes/vape pens are designed with an Internal Battery and pre-filled with e-liquid, providing a specific number of puffs per device. (Calculated around 1.5-1.6 Puffs/Battery mAh) Made for temporary use, disposables are made to discard once either the battery or ejuice reservoir run empty. 

VaporLax’s disposable vape pens are great for beginner vapers who want to try nicotine salt vaping, without the hassle of replacing parts & pieces in a larger pod system. They are also nice to have around – even if you are an experienced vaper and have your own rechargeable device – for times when you are looking for a quick, convenient, and easy-to-use option. Once you have reached the estimated puff count, the remaining battery charge and e-liquid remaining will be low/empty, and at this point is finished/discardable. Disposable e-cigs are small, portable, and can be purchased with different flavors, puff counts, and nicotine strengths to suit every type of vaper. Here are some of the pros and cons of disposable vapes: 

Advantages of Disposable E-cigs & Vapes: Disposable e-cigarettes are easy to use with nearly no moving parts or pieces, convenient for short-term use. They are a cost-effective & low-commitment way to start vaping or trying a new flavor. Most popular disposable vape brands an extensive variety of great tasting and highly satisfying flavors to choose from, finding your preferred flavor. VaporLax e-cigs are made ready-to-use, right out of the box!

Disadvantages of Disposable E-cigs & Vapes: On the other hand, disposable vape pens may be more costly than rechargeable vapes in the long-run. Relying on disposables requires you to be buying new devices when changing flavors or nicotine strengths rather than simply filling a new pod. With rechargeable vapes, the cost of Pod Replacements & new E-Liquids over-time proves to be more economical and sustainable than re-purchasing more disposables. 

Disposable e-cigarettes can be found at gas stations, smoke shops, convenience stores, etc. VaporLax disposables provide a simple and convenient way to enjoy vaping, designed to last for a specified number of puffs. Typically, you can estimate/calculate real puff counts in a disposable e-cig at the rate of 1.5 Puffs per Battery mAh (e.g. Sirius Disposables are made with 1500mAh batteries, 1500x1.5= ~2200 puffs), and once it is used up/finished, simply discard the device. Keep in mind, not all companies label their products with accurate puff counts. Do the math to ensure you get the full value of your purchase. 

For those that are looking for simplicity and convenience, a disposable e-cigarette is a decent choice for short-term use and suitable. Disposables are also a great way to get a feel for a particular company’s products without committing to a more expensive, rechargeable e-cig kit. But keep in mind, it is much more expensive to purchase disposable e-cigs (over time) and you will not have nearly as many options in design, flavor, nicotine levels and other features.

RECHARGEABLE E-CIGS

Rechargeable e-cigs differ from disposable devices in a few ways: With a rechargeable battery and refillable pods/tanks, these are designed to be reused over time. Being refillable, more flavor options are available with rechargeable devices than with disposables. Allowing you to use your preferred e-liquid flavor, that may not be available in disposables. Pod Systems are particularly convenient for using a few ejuice flavors in multiple pods at a time. Made to be refilled, most rechargeable devices use interchangeable or removable cartridges/cartomizers. These replaceable pieces allow you to try new flavors & nicotine strengths with ease. Individuals that enjoy extended customization with their device may prefer rechargeable over disposable devices. Over time these devices prove to be much more cost-efficient since the initial purchase of the device is normally the most expensive. Once you invest in a reliable device, your next purchases should only be low-priced Replacement Pods & E-Liquids. Despite their slightly higher level of complexity, rechargeable e-cigs are still extremely convenient and easy to use. Some people may still prefer disposable over rechargeable for a few specific reasons, including the fact that rechargeable e-cigs come with more parts to keep track of and the requirement a higher initial investment. 

If you still are not sure which type of e-cigarette is right for you and you are just starting out as a new vaper, rest assured that it is hard to go wrong. Both devices are simple and enjoyable, each providing their own unique forms of satisfaction. For the lowest initial cost and the easiest way to see if vaping suits your lifestyle and preferences, we recommend starting with a disposable vape e-cig. However, some vapers tend to gravitate towards rechargeable devices for their customization, reusability, and low long-term cost. Although you will initially pay more for a starter kit, in the long-run the cost of replacement cartridges and e-liquid are much cheaper than repeatedly buying disposable e-cigs. 

In addition to the wider range of flavor and refill options, rechargeable e-cigarettes come in a wide variety of styles that provide varying levels of convenience and performance. Each Mi-Pod PRO comes with 1x Mi-Pod Battery and 2x Replacement PRO Pods, available with countless designs including a build-your-own option. With minimal maintenance, simply fill your pods, charge your device, and enjoy your vaping experience.
